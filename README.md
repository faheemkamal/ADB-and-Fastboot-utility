# ADB-and-Fastboot-utility

A simple utility built from scratch to quickly grab kmsg, logcat, logcat-radio and last-kmsg from your phone.

You need to edit the .cmd file and point it to your adb folder location in your computer.

If it gets stuck saying adb root, simply restart debugging by turning it off and on in developer options. This is due to incomplete logging permissions in the recent roms init file.
